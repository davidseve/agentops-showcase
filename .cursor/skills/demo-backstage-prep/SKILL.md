# Demo Backstage Prep

Final checks after `demo-backstage-install`, before opening to the audience.

**Script companion:** [`docs/demo-script.md`](../../docs/demo-script.md) § Before you go on stage

## Checklist

```
Pre-stage prep:
- [ ] 1. Confirm direct MaaS (no NeMo in path)
- [ ] 2. Ensure MLflow experiment + demo-initial egress (default.yaml)
- [ ] 3. Start presenter panels (UI + observability proxy)
- [ ] 4. Open Control UI + panels (split screen)
- [ ] 5. Optional rehearsal reset
```

### 1. Confirm direct MaaS

```bash
./scripts/demo-disable-guardrails.sh
```

Expected: `Inference route: maas-direct / <model> (direct MaaS)`

### 2. MLflow experiment + demo-initial policy

Ensure the `openclaw-tracing` experiment exists in your workspace (ids are per-workspace — never assume `id=1`):

```bash
./scripts/ensure-mlflow-experiment.sh
```

Re-launch OpenClaw so `openclaw.json` carries the resolved experiment id (fixes `No Experiment with id=1` trace export errors):

```bash
POLICY_FILE=config/openshell/default.yaml INFERENCE_BACKEND=direct make -C deploy launch-openclaw
```

Confirm demo-initial egress (default deny):

```bash
make -C deploy validate-demo-initial
```

Expected: `google.com blocked` and `github.com blocked`

If sandbox was created with wrong policy, re-launch with demo policy:

```bash
POLICY_FILE=config/openshell/default.yaml INFERENCE_BACKEND=direct make -C deploy launch-openclaw
```

### 3. Start presenter panels

Use `demo-presenter-panel` skill or:

```bash
# Optional: verify cluster + ports without starting servers
./scripts/demo-presenter-serve.sh --check-only

# Start static UI (:8765) + observability proxy (:8766)
./scripts/demo-presenter-serve.sh
```

The script prints URLs when ready:

- Live companion (v5, recommended): `http://127.0.0.1:8765/demo/v5/live.html`
- Launcher: `http://127.0.0.1:8765/demo/index.html`

If port `8765` or `8766` is already in use: `lsof -ti :8765 | xargs kill` (or `:8766`).

### 4. Open Control UI

```
https://openclaw-gw--openclaw-ui.<APPS_DOMAIN>/
```

Split screen: Control UI + `v5/live.html`.

### 5. Optional rehearsal reset

```bash
./scripts/demo-reset.sh
```

Then **New session** in Control UI before running tests A–D. Run `demo-reset.sh` again immediately before Scenario C (C-before).

## Expected result

- Browser targets ready: `v5/live.html` + Control UI
- Sandbox on `default.yaml` (MLflow-only egress) with direct MaaS
- No live config changes needed until Test C (`demo-allow-google-egress.sh`) and Test D (NeMo)

- Install: `demo-backstage-install`
- Present: `demo-present`
- Verify: `demo-verify`
